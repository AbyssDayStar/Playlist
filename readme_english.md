# Self-introduction

[English](readme_english.md)
As you can see, this is a playlist. I was originally going to send it privately to my classmates, but they didn't know how to use online storage, so I hosted it on my GitHub page. That's why there are a lot of subjective opinions and second-person pronouns in it.

This is also my first front-end project. I welcome your suggestions for improvement (this project is a combination of manual work and DeepSeek).

**This project is not open to public modification, and I will not maintain it regularly either.**
